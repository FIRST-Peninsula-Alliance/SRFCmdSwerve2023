Untested first version of Command based code for SRF's 2023 werve drive robot for FRC's Charged Up! game.

Swerve Modules are SDS MK4's, driven by Falcon 500's, and Thrifty Bot's absolute analog encoders.

Pretty much includes only the code for the drivebase, but does include the needed DefaultDriveCommand and
and initial command to test Auto mode movment. 

It bear's repeating - this has yet to be tested!
